## Project 1: When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?

### Project Description
In this project, you'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. You'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

Your search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. You'll also filter, group, and order data. Make sure you brush up on these skills before trying this project!

### Project Tasks
1. The ten best-selling video games
2. Missing review scores
3. Years that video game critics loved
4. Was 1982 really that great?
5. Years that dropped off the critics' favorites list
6. Years video game players loved
7. Years that both players and critics loved
8. Sales in the best video game years

## Project 2: What and Where are the World's Oldest Business

### Project Description
An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, you'll explore data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?

Like many business problems, the data we'll explore is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, we will first need to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, we can use manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.

### Project Tasks
1. The oldest businesses in the world
2. The oldest businesses in North America
3. THe oldest business on each continent
4. Unknown oldest businesses
5. Adding new oldest business data
6. The oldest industries
7. Restarurant representation
